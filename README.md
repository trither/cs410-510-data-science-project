Goal 

This project will examine trends in global maternal mortality, with a deep dive into data from the United States. We will also discuss maternal mortality in the context of related indicators including infant mortality and other maternal health data.  


Summary

  In this project we will analyze domestic and international data on maternal and infant mortality.  Maternal mortality is an ongoing global public health problem. There are known effective interventions and rates have dropped over the last century, however hundreds of women still die each day from complications of pregnancy or childbirth. 
We will use Tableau to create visualizations that will illuminate contrasts and trends in this data, geographically and over time. We will also provide a particular look at recent data from the United States, with examination of variation between populations and regions. 
The execution for the project will begin with research on data sources to use. Once we have narrowed down our sources we will begin selecting attributes and trends to showcase in our presentation. Then we will divide up the work to build visualization models. Finally weâ€™ll review and edit our visualizations as a team and prepare a presentation. Our presentation will provide the audience with a general familiarity with this issue in the global context, as well as a more thorough examination of cases of interest.

Team Roles
* The initial phase of data collection and synthesis will be broken down topically, with one team member researching each of global data, US population-level data, and US specific data on subgroups and related indicators.  
* Once the team is familiar with the subject matter and has selected good data for these topics, we will meet as a team to refine the story we want to tell with this data. Based on our goals at that time, we will assign the visualizations as makes sense. 
* All team members will check team slack and keep each other generally informed of individual progress.
* Aster will act as project coordinator.
